Hello! , (මම කෙසරු) I'm Kesaru. I speak Sinhala and to those who are not familiar, those are Sinhalese characters to say I am Kesaru.
While I have countless stories to share, I'll focus on the ones that truly define my journey and aspirations. So, who am I in the present, before we delve into the past or future?

I'm a high school graduate and currently an undergraduate student at SLIIT Malabe. While my academic path has its unique twists, my core passion lies in the boundless world of automation.

### My Vision: Automate Everything

I genuinely believe there's nothing in this world that cannot be automated. My ultimate goal? To automate every task imaginable. Yes, I understand the sci-fi fears, but my vision is about empowering humanity, freeing us from mundane routines, and creating a future where **SOLO-preneurs** thrive, supported by intelligent AI agents handling tasks and sub-tasks. It's a grand dream, currently in the thinking stage, but one I'm committed to bringing to life.

### My Journey with Automation

My hands-on experience with automation began early. I've worked on several projects, though none I'd necessarily "brag" about in the traditional sense. For a period, I focused on automating my own workflow at a company, streamlining almost my entire process.

However, I soon realized that many people harbor a fear of automation. Perhaps I started in the wrong place, but I'm now driven to mitigate this fear, demonstrating how automation can be a powerful tool for good.

Currently, I'm working as a freelance software developer, tackling UI enhancements and building practical applications like barcode readers. On the side, I'm developing a fully automated system for social media content creation and posting. Imagine: you input a topic like "What are the things you should know as a Vibe Coder", and AI handles the research, content generation, and even posting, all with your consent.

### My Toolkit: Skills & Expertise

My skills are a reflection of my problem-solving approach: I learn what's needed to solve the problem at hand.

*   **Python:** My first love in programming, started at age 12. I'm highly proficient and believe it's capable of anything.
*   **Machine Learning & GenAI:** I've taken significant "baby steps" in ML and have a good grasp of Generative AI, including "Vibe Coding."
*   **Problem Solving:** At my core, I'm an engineer, driven by the challenge of finding solutions.
*   **Java:** Skilled from university studies.
*   **Web Technologies:** Proficient in debugging PHP, Node.js, and MERN stack websites from my IT Support background at a major web hosting company. I can also debug and code in **React Frontend**.
*   **Linux & Terminal:** Extensive experience with Linux operating systems, particularly Ubuntu (my favorite for its reliability and security) and macOS (my favorite UNIX OS). I'm comfortable with terminal commands and Bash scripting.
*   **DevOps & Version Control:** Highly skilled in **Git and GitHub**, currently working on CI/CD automation for this very website.
*   **Automation Tools:** Experienced with **Python Selenium Automation**.
*   **Cybersecurity Interests:** From a young age, I've been fascinated by exploring system functionalities and understanding how software interacts at a deeper level.

### Beyond the Code: Interests & Inspirations

When I'm not immersed in code, my mind often wanders to the cosmos. I'm deeply interested in **Astronomy**, especially **Astrophysics**, and even dream of **Mars colonization**.

I'm a firm believer in the "Just Get Things Done" philosophy, inspired by figures like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates. I resonate strongly with Bill Gates' character, particularly his drive to solve larger problems.

My favorite AI so far is **Claude**.

And for my downtime, here are some TV series that have shaped my perspective:

*   **[Sherlock](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/):** My absolute favorite. It fueled my childhood dream of being a detective, solving mysteries, and staying awake until they're cracked. The character of Mycroft in the series also inspires me – powerful, talented, and focused on the bigger picture.
*   **[The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/):** While I'm not a born genius, this show humorously portrayed the world of brilliant minds, and I've always enjoyed that image. Sheldon, of course, is my favorite character.
*   **[Doctor Who](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436889/):** An ongoing series I enjoy, though I haven't seen every episode.
*   **[Lucifer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/):** Purely for entertainment; a fun fantasy take on Christian lore.
*   **[Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/):** A recent watch that provided fascinating insights into the startup world. It reinforced the idea that anyone can achieve anything, despite the dramatization.

This is a glimpse into my world – a blend of automation, ambition, continuous learning, and a touch of humor.
