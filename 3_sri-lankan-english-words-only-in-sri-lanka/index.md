Hey there! I’m Kesaru—born and raised in Sri Lanka, but my English grew up on three diets: schoolbooks and exam papers, TV series and paperbacks, and cousins who’d fly in with crisp accents and casual slang. That mix is exactly how I started wondering: why do we say “short eats” when everyone on TV says “snacks”? Why does a “hotel” serve hoppers? And why did even our English teachers disagree—one insisting “do the needful” was correct, another saying it wasn’t? I kept asking: so what is correct?

The answer that finally calmed me down: English is international. It has variations. Sri Lankan English is one of them—legitimate, lived, and loved. This post is my field guide to the words we grew up with, the ones that make sense here first, and only later everywhere else.

### How I started questioning my English

I learned English in three voices, and they didn’t always harmonize.

- **From school:** Grammar drills, essays, and the textbook “correct.”
- **From screens and books:** British, American, and everything in between.
- **From family:** Cousins who said “tutoring,” while my timetable said “tuition class.”

That’s where the confusion began. Teachers would mark “parcel” as fine for takeaway, others crossed it out. One said “do the needful” was standard; another called it office-ese best avoided. I wasn’t wrong; I was bilingual—just inside one language.

### What “only in Sri Lanka” really means

Not every Sri Lankanism is globally unique, but they’re locally precise. Here’s how I use the labels in this post:

- **Uniquely Sri Lankan:** Borrowed from Sinhala/Tamil or born here, with no neat foreign equivalent.
- **Sri Lankan meanings:** Familiar English words that change meaning on our island.
- **Regionally shared, locally core:** South Asian terms that are central to Sri Lankan life.

Think of it as a map of meaning, not a fence.

### Words that carry the island 

These are the expressions that taste, sound, and move like home. 

| Word | Meaning in Sri Lanka | Notes | International equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hoppers | Bowl-shaped fermented pancakes | “Egg hoppers” have an egg in the center | No exact equivalent |
| String hoppers | Steamed rice-flour noodle nests | From Tamil “idiyappam” | Idiyappam (name differs) |
| Kiribath | Milk rice for auspicious days | Ritual, celebratory | Milk rice |
| Kottu roti | Chopped roti stir-fried with spices | Street-food icon | None |
| Mallung | Lightly cooked greens with coconut | Everyday side | None |
| Watalappam | Spiced coconut custard | Malay influence | None |
| Avurudu | Sinhala/Tamil New Year | April festival | New Year (local name preferred) |
| Baila | Lively dance music | Portuguese roots | Baila (kept as is) |
| Papare | Brass-and-drum band sound | Cricket energy | Marching band (not quite) |
| Perahera | Ceremonial procession | Religious/cultural | Procession (broader) |
| Poya day | Full-moon Buddhist holiday | National holiday | Full-moon holiday |
| Walawwa | Manor house | Heritage architecture | Manor |
| Osari | Sinhala-style sari | Distinct drape | Sinhala sari |
| Trishaw | Three-wheeler/tuk-tuk | Everyday transport | Auto-rickshaw/tuk-tuk |
| Wewa (tank) | Man-made reservoir | “Tank” common in SL | Reservoir |

> A quick note: major dictionaries increasingly record Sri Lankan terms—food, music, festivals, architecture—because these words do real work in global English now.

### English words with Sri Lankan meanings

This is where my teachers disagreed most, and where context is everything.

| Word | Meaning in Sri Lanka | Notes | International equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short eats | Savory snacks/pastries | Cafés, parties, bakeries | Snacks/appetizers |
| Parcel (food) | Takeaway food packet | “Make it a parcel?” | To-go/takeout |
| Big Match | Annual school cricket rivalry | A season, not one game | School derby |
| Batchmate | Same-year peer | School/university | Classmate/cohort |
| Water cut | Scheduled water outage | Utility notices | Water outage |
| Current is gone | Power outage | Colloquial | Power’s out |
| Half-boil (egg) | Soft-boiled egg | Hotel menus | Soft-boiled egg |
| Hotel | Modest eatery | Not lodging | Diner/café |
| Estate | Tea/rubber plantation area | Place identity | Plantation |
| Tuition class | After-school lessons | A national habit | Tutoring |
| Move with | Socialize closely | Colloquial | Hang out with |
| Rubber | Eraser | British influence | Eraser |

### Why teachers disagreed, and what “correct” really is

When I asked “what’s correct?” I was really asking “which audience?”

- **Audience and register:** What flies in an office email in Colombo might jar in a US academic paper. Context sets the rules.
- **Education mix:** Teachers trained across eras and systems (British, American, regional) carry different standards into the classroom.
- **Code-mixing as precision:** Sinhala/Tamil terms in English aren’t errors; they’re sharper tools. “Papare” says more than “brass band.”
- **Living dictionaries:** As usage stabilizes, dictionaries catch up. Recognition follows reality, not the other way around.

So here’s my working rule: correct English is the variety that is clear, respectful, and appropriate to the moment. Sri Lankan English is correct in Sri Lankan contexts—and in any space that’s speaking about Sri Lanka.

### A quick-use glossary you can build on

Use this section when you’re writing captions, menus, scripts, or pitch decks and want the register right.

- **Food and drink**
  - **Bite:** Snack served with drinks.
  - **Fish bun/Chinese roll:** Bakery staples under Sri Lankan names.
  - **Thambili:** King coconut, used as is in English.
- **Places and transport**
  - **Three-wheeler/Trishaw:** Auto-rickshaw; both forms common.
  - **Outstation:** Outside Colombo/the main city.
  - **Line room:** Estate workers’ housing.
- **Weather and geography**
  - **Dry Zone/Wet Zone:** National agro-climatic regions.
  - **Tank bund:** Reservoir embankment.
- **Work and school**
  - **Sit exams:** Take exams (British carryover).
  - **Salary advance:** Short-term payroll loan.
  - **Paper marking:** Grading scripts.
- **Public life and admin**
  - **Grama Niladhari:** Village-level state officer.
  - **Samurdhi:** State welfare program.
  - **Tender calling:** Inviting bids (bureaucratic phrasing).
- **Everyday talk**
  - **Machan:** Buddy/friend (often male-to-male).
  - **Aiyo/Aney/Ane:** Interjections of surprise/sympathy/exasperation.
  - **Mudalali/Kade:** Shop-owner and shop.

I’ll end where it clicked for me. I was in a “hotel” eating hoppers, telling a friend the “current” had gone and there was a “water cut.” I braced for correction. She just asked, “Shall we get egg hoppers too?” That’s when I stopped squeezing Sri Lanka out of my English and started letting Sri Lanka live inside it.

Thanks for reading. If you’ve got a Sri Lankan English word you swear by, share it—I’ll add it here with the meaning only you can give.
